Device Tree Clock bindings for the Zynq 7000 EPP

The Zynq EPP has several different clk providers, each with there own bindings.
The purpose of this document is to document their usage.

See clock_bindings.txt for more information on the generic clock bindings.
See Chapter 25 of Zynq TRM for more information about Zynq clocks.

== PLLs ==

Used to describe the ARM_PLL, DDR_PLL, and IO_PLL.

Required properties:
- #clock-cells : shall be 0 (only one clock is output from this node)
- compatible : "xlnx,zynq-pll"
- reg : set of u32 values, which are the address offsets within the SLCR
        of the relevant PLL_CTRL register, PLL_CFG and PLL_STATUS register
	respectively
- lockbit : the index of the PLL_LOCKED bit in the PLL_STATUS register for this
  PLL
- clocks : phandle for parent clock.  should be the phandle for ps_clk

Optional properties:
- clock-output-names : name of the output clock

Example:
	armpll: armpll {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "xlnx,zynq-pll";
		clocks = <&ps_clk>;
		reg = <0x100 0x110 0x10c>;
		lockbit = <0>;
		clock-output-names = "armpll";
	};
